"""Playback contracts for movies rendered inside an inference node.

A generated video is owned by its node (``embedded_node_id``), which excludes
it from the standalone-tile hit-test. Every seam that made an uploaded movie
playable therefore needs an explicit node-aware counterpart; the compiled
canvas cannot be exercised outside Blender, so these are source-level pins.
