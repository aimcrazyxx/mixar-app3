"""A selected reference image or movie carries Rename / Preview / Export.

A finished inference node wears an Edit / Preview / Export row just above its
card. A reference the user dropped on the board is the same kind of thing to
look at and take away, but it has no settings, so its first button is Rename.
The row is C++ canvas content; these pins are source-level, and the Python
half (export scoping, the rename operator) is checked through the source and
through the bpy-free media helper.
