"""A moodboard drag moves the whole selection, whatever kinds it spans.

The board has ONE selection but TWO drag operators — `MIXIE_OT_moodboard_
select_image` for pictures and text, `MIXIE_OT_moodboard_graph_select` for
cards. Each used to move only its own kinds, so a picture and an inference node
selected together came apart under the mouse: the picture moved and the card
stood still. These are source-level pins — the modals only run inside a built
Blender — on the two halves of the fix: one shared capture of what a drag
carries, and a plain click that replaces the selection on BOTH sides so the
shared capture is never handed items the user thought they had deselected.
