"""`Window.global_areas` yields AREAS, so nothing may walk a `.areas` on it.

The property is Mixar's own RNA addition (`rna_wm_mixar.cc`), and its
collection getter iterates `win->global_areas.areabase` DIRECTLY — upstream's
`ScrAreaMap` never reaches Python, so there is no `.areas` attribute to walk.

Getting this wrong is invisible until runtime and then only inside whatever
callback touched it: the topbar slider's redraw pump shipped
`global_areas.areas` and raised

    AttributeError: bpy_prop_collection: attribute "areas" not found

out of a `bpy.app.timers` callback on every single mode switch. The timer
kept re-registering, so the traceback repeated rather than announcing itself
once, and the slider's thumb never animated.

The topbar is a global area and is genuinely absent from `screen.areas`, so
this property is the only way to tag it — which is why several modules reach
for it and why the shape is worth pinning in one place.
