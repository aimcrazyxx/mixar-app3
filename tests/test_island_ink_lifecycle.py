"""Two island contracts that only bite in the built app.

Both are source-level, in the style of the other island tests: this is a
GPU/window-manager surface with no importable Python half.

1. **The ink canvas's closing edge must run in the island's EMPTY state.**
   ``mixie_chat_draw_ink_overlay`` is the ONE writer of
   ``rt->ink_overlay_active``. With a transcript it runs unconditionally at
   the end of ``mixie_chat_main_region_draw``; with none, the island draws
   its own whole-panel field instead and nothing calls it — so once the
   canvas closed the latch stayed true and ``mixie_chat_ink_handle_event``
   went on eating every press and keystroke for a canvas that was no longer
   drawn.

2. **A Generate that paints disabled must not still submit.** The Splat pane
   dimmed its button and labelled it "Queued..." while a world_labs job was
   live, while the control layout armed it on ``prompt_ok`` alone — a paid
   generation from a button that looked unavailable. Paint and arm are now
   written from the same expression, and the label comes from the kit.
