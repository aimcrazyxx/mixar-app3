"""Tests for Scribble ink overlay moodboard dot grid surface and text output.

When scribble mode is on:
  1. A translucent surface covers the chat window with the same pattern as the
     moodboard background (uniform gray dot grid of filled discs).
  2. The scribble text output window is moved over the new chat topbar, displaying
     the recognized handwriting text in a sleek pill window over the topbar.
  3. That same surface continues over the Agent island's composer, so a stroke
     running off the transcript does not stop at the region seam.

(3) is drawn by the ONE painter the chat owns rather than a copy in the island
-- see tests/test_scribble_canvas_grid.py for why the copy had to go, and for
the arithmetic that keeps the lattice's reserved vertex count honest.
