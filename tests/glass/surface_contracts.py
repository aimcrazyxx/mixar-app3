"""Which Mixar surfaces become glass panes, and which stay flat.

The kit (`tests/test_mixar_liquid_glass_kit.py`) pins the material and the
painter. This file pins the CONVERSION: every surface that should adopt the
material, every control that must not, and the single seam that keeps the two
apart.

These source contracts complement the native build and GUI replay by pinning
surface adoption and exclusions across the overlay:

* a surface left on the flat fill keeps a raw, hand-mixed dark rectangle that
  no longer matches the family — visible only by comparing two screenshots;
* a control converted to a pane bleeds the sheet under it, and a slider track
  that shows the card through it stops reading as a groove;
* a seam that re-implements the material instead of delegating lets one
  surface drift out of the family and stops a palette edit from reaching it;
* a seam that takes a colour lets each call site pick its own tint, which is
  the drift the role table exists to prevent;
* a sweep that keeps no register of what it has covered lets a later pass
  convert a surface twice or miss one, and neither shows up until two builds
  are compared by eye.

Run with the repo venv: ``python -m pytest -q`` from the repository root.
