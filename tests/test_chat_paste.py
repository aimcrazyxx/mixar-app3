"""Ctrl/Cmd+V must paste into the chat composer, focus or no focus.

Text paste used to work through exactly one path: the inline hook in
``interface_handlers.cc``, which only runs while the composer holds
text-edit focus. The keymap chord behind it — the path taken whenever it
does NOT hold focus — was bound to ``mixie_chat.paste_image``, which
returns ``CANCELLED`` for a clipboard carrying no image. So a text paste
made while the composer was unfocused did nothing at all, silently.

That is the normal state after any focus change: ``WINDEACTIVATE`` exits
text editing and nothing re-activates the button. It is also the state an
external dictation tool leaves behind — it puts its transcript on the
clipboard and injects the paste chord, and by then the composer is out of
edit mode. In the Agent Bubble, whose window hides on app deactivation,
this was the only outcome there was.

Pinned here: the unified operator exists and is registered, every plain
paste chord routes to it, the image-only operator keeps the ``CANCELLED``
contract the inline C++ hook depends on, and the chord still matches when
an extra Ctrl/Cmd is held (dictation tools inject the chord with their own
push-to-talk modifier still down).
