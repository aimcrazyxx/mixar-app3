"""Animation for the minimized agent bubble pill while working (not idle).

When the bubble is in its minimized state (the elongated pill, w > h * 4), it
serves as the user's primary interface to Mixie. When Mixie is actively working
(busy agent turn, modifying, or active queue generation), the pill must not
remain static and dim.

Instead, it renders a living, animated representation of work:
  1. The capsule stays the shared PILL glass — no second green rim.
  2. Pulsing gradient on the Mixar logo chip.
  3. Pulsating green activity indicator dot with an expanding/fading ripple halo.
  4. Animated status text with a fixed-width U+00B7 activity field (0..3
     slots) and task prompt context.
  5. Native one-shot scheduling predicts useful mascot frames. Neither the
     draw callback nor the hover policy duplicates its redraw requests.
