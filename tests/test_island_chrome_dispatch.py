"""The island's WINDOW region is shared, so the chat must know when to stand down.

The Agent Bubble reuses the chat editor's own ``mixie_chat_main_region_init``,
which registers the chat's UI handler AFTER ``UI_region_handlers_add`` — both
prepend, so the chat handler gets first look at every LEFTMOUSE press, ahead of
the buttons. That was safe only while no chat hit-target overlapped a ui::Block
button. The five non-Agent panes build their ui::Blocks into that same region, so
the overlap is now total: a click landing where a message's copy chip was last
drawn copied that message and returned ``WM_UI_HANDLER_BREAK``, and the pane
control under the cursor never fired.

Two things are pinned here, because either alone leaves a hole: the handler
stands down when the island's active tab is not Agent, and the per-message
rects it dispatches from are dropped as soon as the transcript stops drawing —
they are a CACHE, not a re-derivation, and every hit test walks them.

Source-level, like the rest of the island's C++ surface.
