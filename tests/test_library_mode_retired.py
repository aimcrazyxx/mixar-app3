"""Library mode is retired: unlisted in the dropdown and unreachable.

``scene.mixie_chat_mode`` is a static ``EnumProperty`` and every mode
dropdown enumerates it — the C++ chat footer, the agent bubble's footer
panel and the bubble menu all bind that one property — so dropping the item
hides it everywhere at once. ``bpy`` is a MagicMock in this suite, so the
property is never really registered; these are source-level contracts.
