"""Source-level contracts for the parts of Scribble Marks that need Blender.

``bpy`` is a MagicMock in this suite, so an operator's ``execute`` cannot be
exercised — a mock accepts every call and returns another mock, which would
make these tests pass no matter what the code did. The repo's answer, used by
the moodboard and job-queue suites, is to pin the contract at the source
level instead. That is what this file does, and it is aimed at the mistakes
that are silent in Blender:

* a positional argument added to one of four call sites and not the others;
* a draw callback that writes scene state;
* session state accidentally saved into the .blend, or scene state that isn't.
