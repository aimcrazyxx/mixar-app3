"""Source-level contracts of the C++ Parallel Agents panel.

The panel is custom-drawn native code with no Python surface to exercise under
the ``bpy`` mock, so what can be checked here is the set of invariants whose
violation is silent at runtime:

* a fixed C++ buffer that is not strictly larger than the Python ``maxlen`` it
  mirrors is an off-by-one on every read (``StringProperty(maxlen=N)``
  registers maxlength ``N + 1``);
* geometry re-derived outside the layout pass goes stale against scroll and
  the slide-in, so clicks land on the wrong card;
* every custom-drawn surface needs a QA target provider;
* resizing the region from inside its own draw callback re-enters region init
  for the region on the stack.
