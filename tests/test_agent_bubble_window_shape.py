"""The Agent pill's window must BE the capsule, not a box containing one.

``Mixar_WindowSetCornerRadius`` is one contract with two implementations.
macOS honours it as a Core Animation mask -- ``layer.cornerRadius`` plus
``masksToBounds`` over a non-opaque window -- so everything outside the radius
is genuinely transparent and the resting pill is all the user sees.

Windows has no Core Animation mask for a GPU window. The on-screen
``GHOST_ContextWGL`` requests eight alpha bits so DWM can composite frost;
``Mixar_WindowHasAlphaChannel`` still reads the chosen format because the
driver can refuse. Vulkan windows use the swapchain's composite-alpha flags
instead of WGL. The pill paints a near-black bed over its whole region
(deliberately -- it is what stops the capsule blinking when the cached region
buffer is stale). Without a framebuffer alpha channel that bed showed as a
hard black rectangle around the capsule. A Windows 11 border line traced the
same rectangle on top.

So the Win32 half owes two things the naive port did not have: no OS border,
and the radius applied as the window's actual SHAPE. Both are pinned here,
along with the two ways a window region silently goes wrong -- a resize that
leaves a stale region clipping live content, and an entry outliving its HWND.

The island asks the same question one level up: its window can be given a
translucent background, and only then do the beds it paints per region have
anything to reveal. That contract is pinned here too, beside the pill's,
because it is the same question put to a different window.

Source-level, because none of it is reachable from Python.
