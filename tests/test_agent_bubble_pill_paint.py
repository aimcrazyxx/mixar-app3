"""The pill's window IS the capsule, so nothing it paints may fall outside it.

That identity is load-bearing three times over: it is what lets the corners be
transparent (``Mixar_WindowSetPerPixelAlpha`` -- see
``test_agent_bubble_window_shape.py``), what makes the hit area exactly the
shape the user sees, and what the seat geometry anchors and drags. The window
therefore cannot be grown to make room for decoration.

Anything drawn outside the pill rect is silently clipped: no error, no warning,
and on a translucent effect not even a visible absence -- it simply never
appears while costing a draw call per frame. The "breathing halo" was the
capsule INFLATED by three units and was clipped in its entirety. Measured on
the running app under the QA harness: the capsule occupied rows 1019..1072 in
the idle frame and in all three busy frames, and the pixel immediately outside
it was bare background in every one.

Pinned at source level because the failure is invisible at runtime -- there is
nothing to assert on a pixel that was never drawn.
