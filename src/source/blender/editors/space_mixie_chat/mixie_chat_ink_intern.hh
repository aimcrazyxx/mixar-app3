/** \file
 * \ingroup spmixiechat
 *
 * Shared internals of the Scribble ink overlay (stylus handwriting-to-text
 * for the chat composer), split like the rules/history overlays across:
 *   - mixie_chat_ink_overlay.cc  (canvas + chrome drawing)
 *   - mixie_chat_ink_events.cc   (stroke capture, idle-commit timer, cursor)
 *   - mixie_chat_ink_util.cc     (RNA bridge, stroke store, JSON serialize,
 *                                 commit dispatch, MIXIE_CHAT_OT_ink_flush)
 *
 * Division of labour: C++ owns the pen — stylus detection, live ink capture
 * with pressure, drawing, and WHEN to convert (idle pause / close / Enter).
 * Python owns the data — `mixie_chat.ink_commit` receives the strokes JSON,
 * rasterizes it, calls the backend `/handwriting/recognize` endpoint and
 * appends the recognized text to `scene.mixie_chat_input`
 * (space_mixie_chat/core/scribble.py).
 *
 * Visibility is the Python-registered WindowManager bool
 * `mixie_chat_ink_visible` (same scheme as the rules overlay); the busy
 * indicator reads `mixie_chat_ink_busy` (written by the Python queue).
