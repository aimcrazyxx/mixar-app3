 *
 * Mixar liquid glass: one drawing kit for every Mixar surface that floats over
 * other content — the agent island, its card and status pill, the viewport
 * agent panel's cards, the Mixar profile cards, menus and popovers, and the
 * Mixie chat.
 *
 * A pane uses one antialiased rounded mask for its tint, top light and rim.
 * An optional caller-owned backdrop adds blurred content and subtle edge
 * refraction. Without that source the kit draws a quiet tinted surface.
 * Embedded GLSL is compiled through Blender's backend-neutral preprocessor.
 * OS frost is separate and applies only to the island and pill windows.
 *
 * WHY THE ROLES ARE ENUMERATED
 * The surfaces differ only in palette and in how hard the blur runs, so they
 * are table entries rather than call-site arguments: a surface cannot drift
 * out of the family by passing a slightly different tint, and re-toning the
 * whole UI is one table edit.
 *
 * COORDINATES
 * Everything is region-local px, in the space the caller has already set up
 * (`ED_region_pixelspace`, or a pushed translate for window-space callers).
 * `MixarGlassSource::rect` and the pane rect must share that one space.
 * Callers that draw in window px (the agent bubble pushes
 * `-region->winrct.xmin`) must offset both rects alike.

 * Windows enables the translucent UI bed here; wm_draw_mixar_glass composites
 * a live, GPU-blurred parent framebuffer beneath it before presenting opaque
 * pixels. Frost therefore does not depend on the driver's DWM alpha handling.
 * Failure, missing framebuffer alpha or high contrast keeps an opaque bed.
 * DwmEnableBlurBehindWindow is an alpha path, not a Windows 10 blur fallback.
 * Keep the rounded HWND region to clip the final GPU composition.
 * Requests are retried after delayed native-view creation.
