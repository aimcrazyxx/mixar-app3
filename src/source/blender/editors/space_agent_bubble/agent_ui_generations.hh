 * "Library" tab for the Agent island: the browser for everything Mixar
 * has made plus every asset library the user has connected.
 *
 * Two sources, one grid (the design's left rail switches between them):
 *  - AI generations: the auto-archived "Mixar Generations" asset library
 *    (`asset_search/core/generation_library.py` already writes it), the
 *    scene's generated moodboard media, the splat worlds in the file, and the
 *    jobs still running in the unified queue.
 *  - Asset Library: every registered asset library, browsable here and
 *    connectable from the rail ("+ Add Library…").
 *
 * Nothing here stores anything. The pane is a VIEW over data other modules
 * already own, exactly like the Queue tab is a view over `wm.mixie_queue`.

 * asset-browser semantics — import method, undo push and placement included.
 * Nothing about the import is re-implemented here.
