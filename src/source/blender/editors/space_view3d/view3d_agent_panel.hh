 *
 * Parallel Agents panel: a bottom-left 3D viewport region that slides in
 * with one card per agent of the running turn — the agent's name (derived
 * from the task it was assigned), its status and its elapsed clock. Three
 * cards are visible at a time; a longer fan-out scrolls.
 *
 * Cards follow tasks; only tasks with a live private workspace expose an eye.
 * The workspace viewer reuses the old strip's offscreen rendering in a large,
 * read-only overlay with switchable tabs.
 *
 * The card data is a read-only projection of the WindowManager mirror that
 * `mixar/modules/agent_panel/core/cards.py` writes from the chat's `todo`
 * slot. All runtime state (scroll, reveal animation, hit rects) is
 * runtime-only — never written to .blend files.
