# Vendored: 3DGS Render by KIRI Engine (v4.1.5)

Upstream: https://github.com/Kiri-Innovation/3dgs-render-blender-addon
Tag: `v4.1.5` (commit `453301d`), Blender 4.3–5.0. Do NOT bump to v5.x —
that line targets Blender 5.1+.

Renders Gaussian splats (3DGS PLY) in real time via a geometry-nodes +
shader setup. Mixar uses it for splat environments (World Labs worlds and
locally imported `.spz`/`.ply` splats): `bootstrap/kiri_3dgs_addon.py`
auto-enables it, and `moodboard/core/world_labs_importer.py` drives its
Serpens-generated operators (`sna.dgs_render_import_ply_e0a3a` to import,
`sna.dgs_render_create_proxy_from_mesh_d5b41` to build the render proxy).

## What was changed vs upstream

**One code patch** (marked `MIXAR PATCH` in `__init__.py`): per-object
visibility. `assets/vert.glsl` culls a gaussian whose object visibility flag
(slot 2 of the 15-float-per-object metadata texture) is `< 0.5`, but every
upstream writer of that slot hardcodes `1.0`, so splats kept drawing through
the addon's `SpaceView3D` handler no matter what the user did in the outliner
— there was no way to hide a splat at all. The patch adds
`mixar_object_visibility(obj)` / `mixar_visibility_signature()` near the top of
the file, feeds the former into all four metadata writers, and — because a
hide changes no transform, and the texture is only refreshed when one does —
adds a visibility check next to `check_any_transforms_changed()` in
`sna_viewport_render_A3941`'s draw loop, plus `mixar_last_visibility` in
`cleanup_multi_object_cache`'s teardown list. Pinned by
`tests/test_splat_lifecycle.py`; re-apply it on any vendor bump.

Deletion is handled Mixar-side instead (nothing to patch here):
`moodboard/core/splat_lifecycle.py` reconciles KIRI's process-global cache and
textures after outliner deletions — see its module docstring.

Omitted from vendoring:

- `wheels/` (~1 GB across platforms: open3d, scipy, dash/flask/plotly).
  The import + render path needs none of them; `open3d` is imported
  lazily at two sites and availability-guarded (its density-based outlier
  filtering feature reports "disabled" without it). scipy/dash/etc. are
  never imported by the addon code.
- `blender_manifest.toml` (extension metadata). We load it as a classic
  add-on via its `bl_info`, discovered from `scripts/addons_core/`
  (Blender maps the bundled scripts dir to `addons_core`, not `addons`).

One asset is transformed: `assets/3DGS Render APPEND V4.blend` (the
geometry-nodes groups + material + HQ/Wire objects the addon appends)
is NOT in the upstream git repo (gitignored; release-zip-only, upstream
ships it uncompressed at 190 MB). We vendor a stripped, compressed resave
(6.7 MB): upstream's file also carries KIRI's demo scene, whose four sample
splat objects (`Faces to 3DGS`, `Faces to 3DGS.001`, `Points to 3DGS`,
`Point Edit cubone` — flamingo/cubone point clouds) were ~150 MB of mesh
data that nothing ever appends. Those objects and their meshes were removed
(their only users were the demo collections and the demo Camera's DOF focus)
and the file saved with `save_as_mainfile(compress=True)`. Every node group,
material, image and appended object is unchanged — verified by appending
each one from the old and new file and diffing the result, and by running
the real import (`sna.dgs_render_import_ply_e0a3a`) + proxy
(`sna.dgs_render_create_proxy_from_mesh_d5b41`) operators against both.
The only ID that no longer survives the save is `KIRI_3DGS_Animate_GNborken`,
an orphaned broken copy used solely by a deleted demo object's modifier and
never referenced by the addon. On a vendor bump, re-apply the same strip
(delete those demo objects + meshes, compressed save).

## Render model (why a splat can look like a green point cloud)

- Viewport: the render **proxy** (`Create Proxy From Active`) draws via
  the addon's own GPU shader pipeline during interactive redraws.
- F12 / animation renders: the splat mesh's `KIRI_3DGS_Render_GN` builds
  camera-facing quads from view/projection matrices pushed into modifier
  sockets — per-object `sna_dgs_object_properties.update_mode =
  'Enable Camera Updates'` (+ `cam_update` for the active camera) must be
  on, or the render is black. KIRI's "Advanced Render" operator automates
  per-frame updates for animations; Director shot-render integration
  should drive the same path.

## Updating

Shallow-clone the desired tag and re-copy `__init__.py`, `assets/`,
`LICENSE`, `README.md`, `Important`; re-extract the APPEND blend from the
release zip (recompress as above). Re-verify the two operator ids above
still exist — `world_labs_importer.py` pins them — and re-apply the
visibility patch (`tests/test_splat_lifecycle.py` fails until you do).
