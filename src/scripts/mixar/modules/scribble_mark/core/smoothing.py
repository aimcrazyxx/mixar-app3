"""Stroke smoothing — the curve the writer sees.

Pointer samples arrive at the event rate and are distance-decimated on
capture, so a fast stroke is a handful of points joined by straight
segments — every corner of the polyline shows. This turns a sampled stroke
into a Catmull-Rom spline through the SAME points (the ink still passes
through every sample the user made, nothing is moved or dropped) and emits
extra points along it.

Three callers, one curve, which is the point: the viewport mark overlay
(``core/overlay.py``), the chat canvas's C++ twin (``ink_smooth_stroke`` in
``mixie_chat_ink_overlay.cc``) and the handwriting rasterizer
(``space_mixie_chat/core/scribble_raster.py``). The rasterizer is why this
is not draw-only any more: the page a recognizer reads has to show what the
user watched come out of the pen, not the chords between the samples. What
is STORED, resolved against the scene and sent as a sketch is still the raw
sample.

The parameterization is uniform, not centripetal. At capture density
(~2 px between samples) the two differ by a fraction of the ink's width,
and this runs per stroke on the draw path; centripetal's guarantee against
overshoot only starts to pay at chord lengths a hand does not produce.

Pure Python, no ``bpy``: pinned by the standalone suite.
