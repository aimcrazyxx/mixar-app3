"""Drawing the marks onto a copy of the frozen frame.

The agent gets the frame **twice**: clean, and with the marks on it. That
split is not tidiness — burning the annotation into the only image you send
is a real failure. Everything downstream that consumes an image consumes this
one, and a generation model handed a picture with a cyan loop drawn on it
will faithfully reproduce the loop. It is the same lesson the ordered
reference-image contract already encodes by keeping ``component_cutout``
beside ``selection_mask`` instead of merging them.

The annotated copy exists for the vision half of the agent: it is what lets a
model *see* what the user circled, in context, at a glance. The clean copy is
what any generation step should actually work from.

Ink is drawn as a dark casing under a bright core, because a single-colour
stroke that reads on a light clay render disappears on a dark material
preview, and the frozen frame can be either.

What is drawn is the RAW INK — each stroke the user put down — not the
gesture polygon. The polygon is a convex hull for every gesture but a loop,
and a hull of a sketched car is a blob: the picture the agent was shown of a
road with cars and trees was a row of blobs, which is a large part of why it
built something else. Records from before strokes were stored fall back to
the polygon.
