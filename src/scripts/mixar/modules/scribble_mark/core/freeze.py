"""Freezing the viewport so the user can draw on it.

Arming mark mode captures the 3D viewport to a still, packs it into the
.blend, and draws it back over the region while navigation is blocked. The
viewport visibly becomes a paused frame you can mark up.

Freezing is not decoration. It buys three things that a live viewport cannot:

* **the pixels the user marked are the pixels the agent sees.** The still is
  attached to the turn, so there is no window in which an orbit, a redraw or
  a depsgraph tick can put the mark somewhere other than what was on screen.
* **marks stay valid while they are being drawn.** Multiple marks across one
  freeze share one frame of reference, so "move THIS over THERE" is two marks
  in the same coordinate system rather than two guesses in drifting ones.
* **an accidental orbit cannot silently invalidate a mark.** Without the
  block, a stray middle-drag mid-gesture would leave marks describing a view
  that no longer exists, with nothing on screen to say so.

The still is packed rather than left on disk: it lives in ``bpy.app.tempdir``,
which is cleaned when Blender exits, and a mark referencing a vanished image
would lose the one thing a VLM can actually read.
