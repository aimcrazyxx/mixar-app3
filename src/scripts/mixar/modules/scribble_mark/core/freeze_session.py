"""One freeze: the still, the camera baked from it, and the size they share.

Split out of the modal operator because it is not UI — it is the bookkeeping
that keeps a mark's three pieces consistent with each other:

* the **still** the user draws on,
* the **camera** a lane renders from to see that same frame,
* the **region size** every normalized coordinate is relative to.

They must be taken together, and a mark is only meaningful against the set it
was drawn on. When the region resizes they stop agreeing — a resized viewport
shows a different extent of the scene, so a raycast through the live region no
longer hits what the old still depicts — and neither size can rescue it:
normalizing against the arm-time size mismaps the mark onto the stretched
still the user actually drew on, while normalizing against the live size pairs
it with a raycast through a view the still no longer shows.

So a resize takes a NEW freeze. Marks already committed keep the view they
were drawn on, which is exactly what the payload's ``views`` map is for.

Finding the viewport lives here too, and returns the owning **window**. The
Agent Bubble is its own ``wmWindow``, so the button that arms this is often
clicked in a window that holds no viewport at all — and Blender binds a modal
handler to ``CTX_wm_window(C)`` and dispatches each window's events only
against that window's own handlers.
