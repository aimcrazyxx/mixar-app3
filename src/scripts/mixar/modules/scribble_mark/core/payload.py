"""Assembling the mark payload — pure, no ``bpy``.

Takes a gesture reading (``gesture.classify``) plus whatever the raycast
resolver managed to establish, and produces the dict that travels to the
agent. Kept free of ``bpy`` so the serialization contract — the part a
backend schema has to agree with — is unit-testable outside Blender.

Two shapes, both versioned:

* a **mark** — one gesture, its 2D region in the frame's normalized
  coordinates, and its client-resolved 3D truth;
* a **payload** — every mark of the turn, plus the ``views`` map they point
  into. Marks made during one freeze share a view; disarming and re-arming
  mints a new one, so a turn can legitimately carry several.

The budget rule: **detail is shed before marks are, and resolution is never
shed at all.** Polygon points are a nicety the agent can live without; which
object the user pointed at is the entire point of the feature.

Above the marks sits the freeze's **intent** (``sketch.read_intent``): the
same ink is either a set of pointing gestures or ONE drawing. A sketch
payload carries a ``sketch`` block — every stroke with its place in the
world — built from the raw strokes each mark stores, which are then left off
the wire (the annotated frame shows them).
