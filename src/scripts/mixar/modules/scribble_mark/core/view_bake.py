"""Baking the frozen view into a real camera.

A mark is only meaningful in the frame it was drawn on. Weeks later, or three
turns later after the user has orbited away, "the region they circled" needs a
viewpoint to be a region *of*. So arming a freeze bakes a camera matching the
viewport exactly, and every mark from that freeze names it.

That gives a lane one line to see what the user saw::

    scene.camera = bpy.data.objects["mixar_mark_view_0001"]

**This camera is not used to resolve marks.** Resolution raycasts through the
live region (``projection``), which is exact by construction for both
perspective and orthographic views. Reconstructing a camera from a viewport
means reasoning about lens, sensor fit and ortho scale, and getting it subtly
wrong is easy — so the reconstruction is confined to the thing whose failure
mode is cosmetic (the picture is framed slightly differently) rather than the
thing whose failure mode is silent and wrong (the agent edits the wrong
object).

The projection is derived from ``RegionView3D.window_matrix`` rather than
``SpaceView3D.lens``. The viewport's focal length is expressed against a
fixed notional sensor that does not match a camera datablock's, so copying
``lens`` across produces a visibly different framing; the projection matrix is
what the viewport actually drew with.
