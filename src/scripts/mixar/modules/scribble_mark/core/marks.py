"""The mark store — marks as addressable scene nouns, not message contents.

A mark that lives only in one turn's message dies to context compaction, and
"make it a bit taller" three turns later then has nothing to resolve against.
So every mark is written into the .blend: a record here, a baked camera, and
(for a partial selection) a vertex group. The agent can come back to any of
them by name.

``get_marks()`` is the sandbox entry point, mirroring the pattern the sketch
pipeline uses::

    from mixar.modules.scribble_mark.core import marks
    data = marks.get_marks()

so a lane re-reads the marks rather than relying on them surviving in context.

Structured fields are stored as JSON strings rather than nested
PropertyGroups. The payload shape is versioned and shared with the backend
schema; mirroring it into RNA would give it a second, silently diverging
definition, and the .blend would need a migration every time a field moved.
