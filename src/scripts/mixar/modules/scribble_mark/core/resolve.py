"""Resolving a mark against the live scene — the heart of the feature.

The backend cannot do this. It has a picture; the client has the depsgraph,
the view matrices, and ``scene.ray_cast``. Shipping a screen rectangle to a
model and asking it to work out what is underneath re-creates exactly the
guessing that a user pointing at something is supposed to end.

Five tiers, each degrading on its own. A failure at tier *n* still ships
everything below it, and **nothing here waits on the network**:

0. the frozen still (``freeze``) — always, and the only thing a VLM can read
1. the 2D region in localizer coordinates (``payload``) — always
2. an anchor raycast: world point, normal, and the object under it
3. a grid of raycasts inside the outline: which objects, and how much of each
4. a vertex group naming exactly the marked faces (``vertex_groups``)

A mark whose rays hit nothing is landed on the world ground plane instead
(``ground``): a layout sketch on an empty viewport is the commonest kind of
mark there is, and "background, no position" would leave it unusable.

Every raw stroke is also sampled into world space (``strokes_world``) —
raycast where the ray meets geometry, the ground plane where it does not —
so that when the freeze's ink is read as a SKETCH (``sketch.py``) each line
of the drawing has a place on the ground to be built at.

Runs on the main thread, from an operator, while the user waits for a message
to send — so it is bounded by ``COVERAGE_GRID`` and by the vertex cap, and
every step is wrapped: a mark that cannot be resolved is reported as
unresolved, never allowed to fail the send.
