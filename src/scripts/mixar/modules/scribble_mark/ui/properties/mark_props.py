"""Scene and WindowManager state for Scribble Marks.

Split by lifetime, which is the whole reason there are two homes:

* **Scene** — the marks themselves, their serial counter, and the name of the
  frozen frame. These belong to the .blend: a mark is a scene noun the agent
  can address turns later, and the vertex groups and cameras it names are
  saved alongside it. Losing them on file reload would make "make it a bit
  taller" unresolvable.
* **WindowManager** — whether mark mode is currently armed, and how the
  user asked the ink to be READ (marks or a sketch). Both describe an
  in-progress gesture, never the saved document; a .blend that reopened
  mid-freeze, with the viewport blocked and no modal running to unblock it,
  would be a file the user could not navigate.

The structured half of each mark is a JSON string rather than nested
PropertyGroups. The payload shape is versioned and shared with the backend
schema; mirroring it into RNA would give it a second definition to drift
against, and every field move would need a .blend migration.
