"""Sliding moodboard drawer state and clock.

Three WindowManager properties shared with the C++ drawer
(``editors/space_view3d/view3d_moodboard_drawer.cc``):

  - mixar_moodboard_drawer_amount: how far the Zen Mode drawer is pulled out,
    0 (shut) .. 1 (open). C reads it on every draw, and writes it on every
    frame of a grip drag.
  - mixar_moodboard_drawer_target: the side the drawer settles on, 0 or 1.
    Written by the grip (a click flips the current target, a release after a
    drag keeps the chosen width or closes a small pull), by ``~``
    (``view3d.moodboard_drawer_toggle``), and by ``view3d.moodboard_drawer_set``.

  - mixar_moodboard_drawer_width: chosen width in UI units, remembered when
    closing and reopening. The factory default (340) is a fallback; the first
    View3D layout promotes it to ~35% of the area once
    ``mixar_moodboard_drawer_width_ready`` flips. Grip travel can fill the
    available viewport.
  - mixar_moodboard_drawer_width_ready: set after the first auto-size or any
    explicit width set, so a harness resize back to 340 is not re-promoted.

C owns the wall-clock ease (``display_amount``, ease-out cubic over
``VIEW3D_MOODBOARD_DRAWER_SLIDE_SECONDS``) and a ``TIMERNOTIFIER`` that
tags only the drawer region. This module's 60 Hz clock calls
``view3d.moodboard_drawer_update`` so RNA meets the target; the C timer
is what paints the in-between frames, because the idle interval here is
0.1 s and waiting on it was the first-frame jump.

All properties are SKIP_SAVE: a half-open drawer is a gesture in progress,
never saved scene data.
