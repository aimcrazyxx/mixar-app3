Turnaround / Multi-View Group Model

A turnaround (model sheet) is a single image showing the same character from
several angles. Sending the whole sheet to an image-to-3D engine makes it try
to model every panel as one object, which produces garbage — so it is split
into per-view crops that submit as ONE multi-view job.

The shape mirrors the vendor's: Hunyuan Pro takes **one frontal image plus up
to seven angles**. The frontal image is the Model Gen tab's **Input Image**;
the turnaround group holds the seven *companions* only, each carrying a
``view_type`` from ``constants.TURNAROUND_VIEW_TYPES`` (exactly the vendor's
``ViewType`` enum). There is deliberately no 'main', 'front' or 'none' label:
membership is ``turnaround_group != ""``, and the main image is whatever the
tab currently points at.

Groups come from the backend detector (:mod:`turnaround_detect`) or are
assembled from the moodboard selection, and the two mix freely — which is why
a companion may carry either an S3 key (detected, already staged backend-side)
or inline pixels (added by the user).

A set is BOUND to its frontal image by ``item.turnaround_main_group``, set on
that one image and nowhere else. A set is submitted alongside an image if, and
only if, the image being converted carries the set's id there — so an
unrelated board image (or a later, different subject) can never inherit
someone else's companions. ``tab_image_to_3d.turnaround_group`` still names the
set the Multiple Views panel edits, but that is UI state only; it does not
decide what a generation submits.
