"""Duplicate moodboard inference nodes, links included.

A duplicate is a SNAPSHOT of plain dicts, re-materialised as new nodes -- never
RNA pointers, so the copy is independent of the originals from the moment it is
taken. This module keeps no clipboard state of its own: Shift+D snapshots and
re-materialises in one breath, and the board's ONE clipboard
(``moodboard_clipboard`` over ``clipboard_snapshot``) reuses the serializers
here so a copied node is the same plain-dict value whether it is pasted back
into this scene, into another scene, or -- through the on-disk copy buffer --
into another running Mixar. That is why every image is referenced by NAME and
resolved through an injectable ``image_resolver`` at paste time.

The node's CONFIGURATION travels, and so does the finished IMAGE or VIDEO it was
showing -- a copy of a card that has generated something looks like the card it
was copied from. What never travels is the node's claim on the queue: ``job_id``
and the live progress text stay behind (see ``_RESULT_FIELDS``), so two cards can
never fight over one job. A node that has NOT finished -- draft, queued, running,
or terminal with nothing to show -- still pastes as a fresh DRAFT.

Link rules, matching what a node editor does on duplicate:
  * a link whose BOTH ends are in the copied set is recreated between the
    copies, so the shape of the selection is preserved;
  * a link INTO the set from an outside source is recreated from that same
    source, so a duplicated "Generate Image" keeps its reference image;
  * a link OUT of the set into an outside node is NOT recreated -- it would
    double-feed a downstream input socket that already has a source.
