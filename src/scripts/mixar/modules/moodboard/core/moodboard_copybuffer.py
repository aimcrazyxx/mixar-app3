"""On-disk copy buffer: what lets a moodboard copy paste into ANOTHER Mixar.

Blender's own cross-process copy/paste (objects in the 3D viewport) works by
writing a partial ``copybuffer.blend`` into the shared temp directory and
appending from it on paste. The moodboard does the same with two files beside
each other in that directory:

* ``mixar_moodboard_copybuffer.blend`` -- a partial ``.blend`` written with
  ``bpy.data.libraries.write`` holding every Image datablock the copied items
  reference. Packed stills travel with their bytes; movies (which Blender
  cannot pack) travel as an ABSOLUTE file path, which is exactly right for two
  instances on one machine.
* ``mixar_moodboard_copybuffer.json`` -- the manifest: the clipboard SNAPSHOT
  (``clipboard_snapshot``: positions, text boxes, node configuration, links),
  the image names the ``.blend`` carries, and a per-process token so the
  process that wrote the buffer recognises its own copy and pastes it
  in-process (sharing datablocks) instead of re-importing it.

The manifest is written LAST and atomically, so a reader never sees a snapshot
whose ``.blend`` is still being written. A buffer left behind by an earlier
session stays valid, like Blender's -- staleness against the OS clipboard is
arbitrated by the paste operator, not here.
