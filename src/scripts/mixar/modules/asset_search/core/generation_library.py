"""
Auto-curated "Mixar Generations" asset library.

Every completed image->3D / model-3D generation is archived into a
Mixar-owned asset library (registered like any user library) and, once the
generation queue has drained of qualifying jobs, embedded via the existing
incremental training flow — so past generations become reusable (agent
library picker + Assets-workspace search) instead of being regenerated.

Implemented entirely as a queue LISTENER so nothing in common/job_queue
changes: the listener fires on every job state change, saves newly-succeeded
qualifying jobs, and triggers one incremental retrain when the qualifying
queues drain (which also fires when the last job FAILS).
