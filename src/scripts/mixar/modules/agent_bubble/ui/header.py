"""Agent Bubble — header.

Two render modes, distinguished by region presence:

  * MAIN BUBBLE WINDOW (has TOOLS region):
      drag-handle ▬▬▬▬ centered + traffic-light buttons.

  * FLOATING PILL WINDOW (HEADER only, no TOOLS):
      just the status pill text + dot, centred as a clickable
      restore button. The pill window is a separate small window
      attached as a child of the main bubble — see
      Mixar_WindowSetParent and the open-op code in
      space_agent_bubble.cc that creates it. Both windows use the
      same SPACE_AGENT_BUBBLE editor, so this single Header drawer
      runs in both.

Detection uses region presence (TOOLS region exists only in the
main bubble) — DPI-invariant, unlike pixel-width thresholds.
