"""Redraw heartbeat for the island's Library tab.

Two things on that tab change without any event to notice them:

* Asset libraries load ASYNCHRONOUSLY. ``ED_asset_list``'s fetch returns
  before the read is done, and previews load later still, on their own
  threads. The pane paints "Loading assets…" in the meantime and has to be
  repainted when the data lands.
* A "GENERATING" tile's age line ticks while its job runs.

A redraw tagged from inside a draw callback does not wake Blender's idle
loop, so the pane cannot drive its own frames — same constraint the chat's
animation pump and the topbar's slider pump live under, and ``bpy.app.timers``
is the sanctioned answer.

Cheap by construction: the tick does nothing at all unless an island exists
AND it is showing this tab, so every other session pays one dictionary lookup
every quarter second.
