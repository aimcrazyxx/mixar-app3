"""Actions for the island's Library tab.

The pane itself is C++ and stateless — everything it can DO is one of the
operators below, bound to a painted button. Each one is deliberately thin and
delegates to a flow that already exists:

- Connecting a library calls Blender's OWN ``preferences.asset_library_add``
  rather than writing ``preferences.filepaths.asset_libraries`` here. That
  operator does the prefs write, sets the dirty flag, posts the notifier and
  clears the asset-list cache — four things a hand-rolled append would have to
  get right, and one of them (the cache clear) is why a hand-added library
  shows up empty until a restart. Like Blender, it does not force a
  ``save_userpref``: Preferences auto-save is what persists it, and forcing a
  write would also flush every unrelated preference the user is mid-edit on.
- Adding an asset to the scene goes through ``core/spawn_asset.py``. It
  loads the datablock with ``bpy.data.libraries.load`` and links it into a
  collection the viewport can see, then frames it. ``wm.append`` is not used:
  from this window it returns ``{'CANCELLED'}`` without raising and has no
  View3D to frame the result, so the button used to report success while the
  grid stayed empty. Dragging a tile does not come through here at all — that
  is Blender's asset drag and the View3D's own asset dropbox.
- Selecting a still or a movie selects it ON THE MOODBOARD, which is the
  app-wide way an image becomes a reference (the chat composer mirrors the
  board selection, and Video Gen reads it directly). The image is already
  boarded — that is where the pane found it — so "add" would be a no-op and
  "select" is the honest verb.

No operator here writes anything the user did not ask for by clicking it.
