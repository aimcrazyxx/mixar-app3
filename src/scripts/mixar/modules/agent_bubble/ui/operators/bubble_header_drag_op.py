"""Drag the Agent Bubble header to move the whole window.

On macOS, hands off to AppKit's native performWindowDragWithEvent:
On Windows, uses a modal operator: begin_drag stores the initial
cursor + window position, update_drag repositions on each
MOUSEMOVE using GetCursorPos (screen coords — immune to the
coordinate-system-moves-with-the-window problem), end_drag cleans
up on LEFTMOUSE RELEASE.

Bound to LEFTMOUSE PRESS in the global Window keymap. Scoped by:
  * poll(): only AGENT_BUBBLE space
  * invoke(): only the HEADER can move the island; content owns its gestures.
    While Handwriting is open (``mixie_chat_ink_visible``),
    the header also passes through so handwriting cannot start a window drag.
  * begin_drag refuses (and invoke passes through) when the press is
    already owned by a uiBut waiting to start its own drag, e.g. a My
    Generations asset tile — window handlers run after every region
    handler, so without that check the window move wins the gesture.
    It also refuses for the same Scribble flags.

The PILL window (the island's status pill, and the elongated resting pill
while the island is minimised) is one press with two meanings, decided by
how the press ENDS rather than acted on at PRESS time:

  * released without travelling ``PILL_DRAG_THRESHOLD_PX`` — a CLICK: the
    minimised pill restores the island (``mixar.bubble_restore_user``), the
    status pill above an open island minimises it. The pill does not open
    on hover; outside mouse presses dismiss the island. One exception: a
    click on the Sketch pill's Voice button toggles dictation instead
    (``mixar.bubble_pill_voice``, which hit-tests the painted button natively
    and declines every other click).
  * travelled past the threshold — a DRAG: ``mixar.bubble_window_begin_drag``
    moves the pill window (AppKit takes the gesture over on macOS; the modal
    drives ``update_drag``/``end_drag`` on Windows). The C++ side refuses the
    drag for the status pill above an OPEN island (it is re-seated on the
    island's every move), in which case the gesture ends as nothing — not a
    click either, because the user moved.
