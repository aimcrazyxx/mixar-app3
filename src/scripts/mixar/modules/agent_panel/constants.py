"""Parallel Agents panel constants.

The panel is drawn in C++ (``view3d_agent_panel_*.cc``), which reads the
WindowManager card mirror this module's ``core/cards.py`` maintains. Every
string maxlen here is paired with a strictly larger C++ stack buffer
(``AGENT_PANEL_*_BUF`` in ``view3d_agent_panel.hh``) — ``StringProperty``
registers maxlength ``maxlen + 1``, so a buffer of exactly ``maxlen`` bytes
is an off-by-one on read.

#: Agent display name ("Back window", derived from the task label).
AGENT_NAME_MAXLEN = 96
#: The full task label the agent was given.
AGENT_TASK_MAXLEN = 256

#: Below this many tasks a turn with NO OPEN RUN is not a parallel fan-out and
#: the panel stays closed: one task is just the chat's own todo line repeated,
#: and a lone finished task would pop the panel only to dismiss itself.
#:
#: While the run IS open the minimum does not apply: the orchestrator ends its
#: turn right after delegating, so a batch of one — the first task, or the one
#: task a later acceptance adds — is ordinary, and its worker then builds for
#: minutes with the card as the only indicator the user has.
MIN_CARDS_FOR_PANEL = 2

#: Cards visible before the stack scrolls (the reference design's three).
VISIBLE_CARDS = 3

AGENT_NAME_TARGET_CHARS = 34

#: How long a finished card stays on screen before it slides out, and how long
#: the slide takes. A completed agent has nothing left to say, so its card
#: leaves rather than accumulating over the viewport — but not so fast that the
#: check mark never registers.
#:
#: **These are duplicated in `view3d_agent_panel.hh` and must agree.** Python
#: owns WHEN the card is removed from the mirror; C++ owns the animation, timed
#: from its own first sighting of the DONE status. If the C++ half outlasts the
#: Python half the card vanishes mid-slide. Pinned by
#: `tests/agent_panel/test_agent_panel_contracts.py`.

#: A card that FAILED never slides out on its own — a failure is the one thing
#: on this surface the user may still need to act on.
