"""Pick which installed Blender version to import plugins from.

Splits the two questions callers actually ask, which
:func:`discovery.newest_source_version` conflates:

- "Is any Blender installed at all?"
- "Is there anything worth importing?"

Newest-by-version-number is the wrong answer to the second one. Blender
creates a version's config dir on first launch, so immediately after an
upgrade the newest dir exists and is empty while every plugin the user
cares about is still under the previous version. Plugin import must not
tell someone with a fully populated Blender 5.0 that no Blender was
found because an empty 5.1 exists.

So: prefer the newest version that actually *has* user plugins, and fall
back to the newest that merely exists, letting the caller tell the two
apart via :attr:`SourceChoice.has_plugins`.

No ``bpy`` import — unit-testable outside Blender.
