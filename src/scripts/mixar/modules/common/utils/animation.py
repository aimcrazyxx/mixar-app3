"""Slotted-action-safe F-curve access shared by paint and Director.

Blender 5 stores animation in layered actions with per-slot channelbags
and no longer exposes the legacy ``Action.fcurves`` collection. Every
read or removal of F-curves goes through these helpers,
which resolve the assigned slot's channelbag and fall back to the legacy
collection only for actions loaded from older files.
