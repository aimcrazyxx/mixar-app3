"""Cached subscription/usage snapshot backing the top-bar meter.

Deliberately free of ``bpy`` so the percentage and threshold logic can be
unit-tested outside Blender. The module-level cache lives here; the
:mod:`..core.poller` owns *when* it is refreshed and the UI layer only
ever reads it.

Percentages come from the backend's ``usage_pct`` (credits **used**) and
are never recomputed from the balance — the server already handles
grandfathered per-cycle allocations, trial allocations and clamping, and
a second client-side formula would drift from the web dashboard.
