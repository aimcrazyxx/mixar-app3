# of MB. 600 s covers ~150 MB at 250 KB/s (a 2 Mbit/s effective home line) or
# ~50 MB at 85 KB/s. Slower than that floor is a stall, not a slow connection,
# and the user is better served by a failure they can retry than by an
# unbounded spinner holding a concurrency slot. It also bounds a job's whole
# worst case at ~70 min, since MAX_POLL_DURATION (3600 s) is the other half.

# Backoff is 2 s then 4 s, so retries add at most ~6 s of sleep. The retry loop
