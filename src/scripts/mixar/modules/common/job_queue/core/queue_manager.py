"""FeatureQueue — per-feature singleton that drives the job lifecycle.

Lifecycle (per job, all callbacks fire on the main thread via api/processor):

    PENDING → RUNNING_SUBMIT → RUNNING_POLL → RUNNING_DOWNLOAD → SUCCESS
                       │              │               │
                       └──── FAILED / CANCELLED / PAUSED_AUTH

All pending jobs are submitted immediately (the backend handles concurrency
and queue limits). Once submitted, jobs wait for backend ``job.update`` pushes
over the agent WebSocket; terminal success reconciles full result data via
``job.sync`` on that same socket. Download runs on a daemon thread that
schedules the import callback back on the main thread — that half of the
lifecycle lives in ``queue_download.DownloadMixin``.
