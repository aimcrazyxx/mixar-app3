"""Human-facing text for queue jobs — shared by every surface that shows one.

The Queue UIList row and the Agent Bubble status pill describe the same job
in the same words, so the catalog lookup and the elapsed formatter live here
rather than in either surface. Both are pure and catalog-tolerant: they are
called from draw callbacks, which must never raise and must never write RNA.

Capability labels are BACKEND-OWNED (the generation catalog), so they change
without a client release — never hardcode a service→label map here.
