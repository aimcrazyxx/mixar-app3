"""Result download / import half of the job lifecycle.

Split out of ``queue_manager`` as a mixin so the download policy (total
deadline, ``Content-Length`` verification, bounded retries, prompt cancel,
progress reporting) has room to live somewhere readable. ``FeatureQueue``
inherits it; every method here is a ``FeatureQueue`` method and relies on
``self._notify`` / ``self._pump`` / ``self._jobs`` from that class.

Threading contract, which is the easiest thing to get wrong here:
``_bg_download`` is a daemon thread. Nothing it runs may touch ``bpy`` or
call ``self._notify()``. It writes plain byte counts onto the ``Job`` and a
main-thread ``bpy.app.timers`` tick turns those into UI updates.
