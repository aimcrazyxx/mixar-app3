Notification System

Thread-safe notification store with GPU/BLF toast rendering in the
3D viewport. Push notifications from any thread; they are displayed
as toasts in the viewport's bottom-left lane, above the agent stack.
This is the one surface for alerts — completions, failures and refusals
are pushed here, never opened as popup menus under the cursor.

Usage::

    from mixar.modules.common.notifications import get_notification_store

    store = get_notification_store()
    store.push("success", "Done!", body="Model exported successfully")
