"""Reduce any outbound network exception to one actionable failure.

The bundled clients (``requests``, ``httpx``, ``urllib``, ``http.client``,
``websocket-client``) raise different exception trees for the same underlying
problem, and ``requests`` in particular folds TLS, proxy and firewall failures
into one ``ConnectionError``. Support cannot act on "Unable to connect to
server". This module walks the exception chain and matches the root cause
against known signatures, producing a short user message, a support code and
an IT-facing hint.

Classification is name/message based on purpose: it must not import the HTTP
libraries (some are optional, all are slow to import) and it must stay
correct if a library is upgraded.
