"""Scribble operators — Python side of the handwriting ink overlay.

The C++-drawn ink canvas (``editors/space_mixie_chat/mixie_chat_ink_overlay.cc``)
opens only through the explicit Handwriting control. Viewport annotation,
pen selection and Voice do not open it.

While it is open the overlay captures strokes and, once the pen has been
still for ``SCRIBBLE_IDLE_COMMIT_MS``, dispatches ``mixie_chat.ink_commit``
with them and clears its canvas so the user can keep writing. All the work
that follows — validation, rasterizing, the recognition request, appending
to the composer — lives in ``core/scribble.py``.
