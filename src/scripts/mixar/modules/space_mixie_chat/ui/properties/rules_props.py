"""Project Rules Properties

``scene.mixie_chat_rules`` holds the persisted rules store — a compact
JSON list of ``{"text", "enabled"}`` entries (see ``core/rules.py``; a
legacy plain-text value parses as one enabled rule). Enabled rules are
concatenated and prepended to the first message of every new chat
session. The property is deliberately persisted (no SKIP_SAVE): rules
belong to the .mixar file and must survive save/reload, but a brand new
file starts with the default empty string.

Chats are per-scene (one agent per scene), while rules are per-FILE — the
update callback mirrors every edit onto all other scenes so each scene's
chat sends the same rules. Scenes created after the last edit start empty;
``core/rules.py:get_raw_rules`` falls back to any non-empty scene for
that case.

The C++ rules overlay never parses the JSON: it reads the
``WindowManager.mixie_chat_rule_entries`` mirror (rebuilt by
``rules_ops.sync_rule_entries`` on overlay open and after every rule
operator), exactly like the history overlay reads its entries mirror.
