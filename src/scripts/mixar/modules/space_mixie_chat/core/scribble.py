"""Mixar Scribble — handwriting strokes to text in the chat composer.

The C++ ink overlay captures the strokes and, ~``SCRIBBLE_IDLE_COMMIT_MS``
after the pen lifts, dispatches ``mixie_chat.ink_commit`` with them as JSON
and clears its canvas. Everything from that point is here: validate the
payload, read it on device if this platform can (``scribble_local``), else
rasterize it (``scribble_raster``), POST it to the handwriting endpoint, and
append the transcription to ``scene.mixie_chat_input``.

**The queue carries strokes, not pixels.** The two recognisers frame the ink
differently — a text line for the platform reader, a 1280 px page for the
vision model — so there is no one raster to share, and the backend's is only
rendered if the backend is actually reached.

**Pipelined on the wire, delivered in order.** A user writing continuously
produces a new batch every pause, and each round trip is about a second at
the model's floor. Waiting for one batch to land before posting the next
would make the composer lag further behind the pen with every pause, so up
to ``SCRIBBLE_MAX_IN_FLIGHT`` batches travel at once — but their text enters
the composer strictly in the order it was written: a batch that lands early
waits for the ones before it. Later batches queue behind the in-flight ones.

The hint is resolved when a batch is POSTED, not when it is queued, so a
batch that waited for a slot continues the sentence its predecessors already
appended. A batch that starts while another is still in flight sees the
composer as it is at that moment — the hint is advisory, and the recognizer
is told the image is authoritative.

``bpy`` is reached only through late imports so the standalone test suite can
exercise the parsing, spacing and queue logic outside Blender.
