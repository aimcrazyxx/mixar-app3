"""Frame-level reads for the JSON-RPC WebSocket client.

websocket-client's ``WebSocket.recv()`` folds every control frame into an
empty string: a server CLOSE (and its status code), a protocol PING and a
PONG all come back as ``""``. The client therefore could not tell a
deliberate auth rejection (close 4001) from a backend restart (1012), a
Redis registration failure (1011), a replaced connection (1008) or a plain
handshake timeout — and it counted every one of them as an authentication
failure, giving up on reconnection for good after three in a row. A backend
restart is exactly the moment those transient closes and slow handshakes
cluster, so the desktop showed "Reconnecting" through the outage and then
never came back once the backend was up.

Reading through ``recv_data(control_frame=True)`` keeps the opcode and the
close payload, so the loop can react to what the server actually said.
bpy-free by design: this runs on the WebSocket receive thread.
