"""Enqueue-time asset prefetch for heavy texture-apply scripts.

Scripts execute synchronously on Blender's main thread, so any network wait
inside a script freezes the UI (macOS beach ball). For known texture-apply
tools the asset URLs are visible in the script text the moment it arrives on
the WebSocket thread — so we start downloading them THERE, and the executor
timer simply holds the script (UI fully responsive, one cheap flag check per
tick) until the cache is warm. Execution then pays only image decode + node
build, not the network.

The prefetch is best-effort in that it never blocks the UI, but it is not
silent about failure: a prefetch that fails, or that passes the wait cap, has
the script REFUSED with an explicit error rather than falling through to a
main-thread download — that fallback is the UI freeze the prefetch exists to
prevent. Only a script we start no prefetch for (an unknown tool, or one with
no extractable image URL) keeps the old in-build download path.
