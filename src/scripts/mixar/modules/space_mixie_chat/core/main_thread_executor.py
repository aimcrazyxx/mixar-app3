"""
Async script execution queue for main thread execution.

Architecture:
- Request queue: ExecutionRequest values from the WebSocket thread
- Timer polls request queue, executes ONE script per tick
- Responses pushed directly to WebSocket client's outbound queue (thread-safe)

This approach is non-blocking and prevents UI freezes by:
1. WebSocket thread queues requests (never executes scripts)
2. Timer on main thread polls and executes ONE script per tick
3. Responses are sent directly via client.queue_response() to avoid
   cross-thread queue polling (which caused segfaults in Blender's embedded Python)

The take/execute/respond sequence lives in
``mixar.modules.common.agent_execution.pump`` and is shared with the headless
worker pump (``headless/headless_main.py``); scene routing and history live in
``main_thread_routing``.
