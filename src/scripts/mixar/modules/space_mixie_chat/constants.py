# The backend addresses every execute_script with a `session_id` that acts as a
# scene-routing key (backend: decorator.execute_script_on_instance / services).
# - "agent:{connection_id}" is the CONSTANT per-connection routing session used
#   for normal / sandbox mode. It intentionally matches NO scene.mixie_session_id
#   so the client follows in-script window.scene changes (active-scene follow).
# - An empty session_id has the same "no explicit scene" meaning.
# - Any OTHER non-empty session received from the backend is a REAL per-scene
#   target: either the user's main scene mixie_session_id (normally a UUID v4
#   set by SessionManager.start_session) or a throwaway lane scene keyed
#   "agentlane:{parent}:{n}" (scene-build mode). Direct-provider ids use a
#   separate local-only prefix and are never placed on this backend channel.
#   These MUST resolve to a scene or the script is rejected — running one against
#   the wrong (active) scene corrupts the user's work.

# Liveness grace probe: the receive thread starves whenever Blender's main
# thread holds the GIL through a long script/render, so on wake the liveness
# window can be expired even though the server kept the connection healthy
# the whole time (it tolerates long pong gaps precisely for this case). On
# expiry the client first sends a ping and waits this long for ANY inbound
# traffic before declaring the link dead — a genuinely dead TCP connection

# ping interval + 5s grace of silence almost certainly means the network is
# gone — the pill flips to Reconnecting/Disconnected here (~5-20s after the
# drop) instead of waiting out the full teardown watchdog above. Deliberately
# a SEPARATE, earlier threshold: send-gating keeps using is_connected because
# a false "down" there would drop work, while a false "down" on a label is
# just a few seconds of pessimistic UI. Must stay well below

# a healthy stream always carries bytes well within this window — a long
# silence means the TCP connection died (network drop, sleep/resume, NAT
# rebind). Was 630s (backend 600s tool timeout + margin) before keepalives
# existed, which left a dead mid-turn stream undetected for 10+ minutes.
