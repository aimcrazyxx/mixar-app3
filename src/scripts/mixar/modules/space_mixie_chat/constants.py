#   main scene mixie_session_id (a UUID v4 set by SessionManager.start_session)
#   or a throwaway lane scene keyed "agentlane:{parent}:{n}" (scene-build mode).

# (network drop, sleep/resume, NAT rebind) — sends still "succeed" into the
# kernel buffer on such a zombie, so only the recv side can detect it. On
# expiry the client PROBES first (see below) and tears the socket down only

# thread holds the GIL through a long script/render, so on wake the liveness
# window can be expired even though the server kept the connection healthy
# the whole time (it tolerates long pong gaps precisely for this case). On
# expiry the client first sends a ping and waits this long for ANY inbound
# traffic before declaring the link dead — a genuinely dead TCP connection
# still tears down at WS_LIVENESS_TIMEOUT + this grace (~50s), while a
# GIL-starved wake-up proves the link alive within ~1s and carries on.

# UI transport-staleness threshold: how long recv may be silent before the
# status surfaces (bubble pill, chat header) stop implying a healthy
# connection. A healthy connection carries at least a pong per ~15s ping, so
# ping interval + 5s grace of silence almost certainly means the network is
# gone — the pill flips to Reconnecting/Disconnected here (~5–20s after the
# drop) instead of waiting out the full teardown watchdog above. Deliberately
# a SEPARATE, earlier threshold: send-gating keeps using is_connected because
# a false "down" there would drop work, while a false "down" on a label is

# inside a borrowed window, so checkpoints actually exist — and their
# granularity/cost is governed here.

#   below), so Ctrl-Z steps back through a turn one tool at a time — e.g.
#   revert just the applied texturing and keep the build.
#   True: one shared checkpoint per agent turn — the pre-turn state is one
#   Ctrl-Z away and undo memory stays flat in very heavy scenes, at the price
#   of all-or-nothing undo.

# scene as it was before the agent touched it. The first push of a turn is
# always that pre-turn state (execute() pushes BEFORE running the script);
