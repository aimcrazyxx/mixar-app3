"""Retime a shot with the Cinema Mode Speed slider.

``shot.speed`` scales every interval between the shot's keyframes relative
to the FIRST beat, whose frame never moves::

    factor(speed) = 2 ** (-speed)
    frame = first + round((time_base - first) * factor(speed))

``beat.time_base`` is the beat's frame at speed 0 — the timing as captured.
Storing it as a float per beat is what keeps a slider drag drift-free: one
drag fires the update dozens of times, and rescaling the current integer
frames on every tick would accumulate rounding until the shot came back
from ``0 -> 1 -> 0`` with different frames. The speed update therefore never
derives ``time_base`` from the frames; every OTHER writer of ``beat.frame``
(capture, adoption, timeline drags, shot split) records it through
:func:`note_beat_timing` / :func:`shift_shot_timing`.

Beats saved before this feature carry ``time_base == 0.0`` and are backfilled
lazily from their frame, so old files behave as if their current timing is
speed 0.
