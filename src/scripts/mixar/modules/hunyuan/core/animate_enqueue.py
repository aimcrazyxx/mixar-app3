"""Animate enqueue helpers — Tripo auto-rig and animation retarget.

Two job kinds behind the Animate moodboard tab:

* **Auto Rig** (``tripo_rig``): ALL selected meshes are exported together
  into ONE GLB and submitted as a SINGLE job, so a segmented character
  (a mesh split into parts) is rigged as one skeleton instead of one
  independent rig per part — and Tripo runs a single rig-check over the
  whole body plan rather than misreading each isolated part. The import
  hook stamps every imported object with :data:`ANIMATE_RIG_JOB_PROP` —
  OUR queue job id — which is the retarget input; the backend resolves it
  to Tripo's task id with an ownership check, so vendor task ids never
  reach the client.

* **Animate** (``tripo_retarget``): no file upload — the payload carries
  the ``rig_job_id`` read from a previously imported rigged object plus
  the catalog params (animation preset, in-place). The result GLB comes
  back with the animation baked in and imports as a new animated copy.
