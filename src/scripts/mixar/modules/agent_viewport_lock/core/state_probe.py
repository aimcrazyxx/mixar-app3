Agent run-state probe for the viewport lock.

Single source of truth for "is the agent actively executing a turn?"
— used by both the halo renderer (what to draw) and the input-block
modal (when to consume clicks). Reads ``scene.mixie_chat_state`` (the
same enum the agent bubble status pill uses) plus
``scene.mixie_chat_active_turn_mode`` (the mode the running turn was
started in).

# user) and IDLE/CONNECTING/OFFLINE.

def is_agent_executing(scene=None) -> bool:
    """True when an AGENT-mode turn is mid-execution on the given
    scene (or the context scene if none passed). Never raises.

    Gated on ``mixie_chat_active_turn_mode == 'AGENT'`` — the mode the
    RUNNING turn was started in, stamped by ``SessionManager.set_state``
    — NOT the live ``mixie_chat_mode`` dropdown. The dropdown stays
    editable mid-turn, so keying off it let a mid-run flip to Ask (and
    back) drop the halo + input block while the agent was still editing
    the scene, letting the user select objects out from under it. The
    lock only applies to autonomous agent runs — not Ask (Q&A) or
    Generate (image/3D generation) turns, which also go BUSY but don't
    edit the viewport.
