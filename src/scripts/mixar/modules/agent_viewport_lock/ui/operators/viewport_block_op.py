Agent viewport input block.

A background modal operator that runs while the agent is executing a
turn. It consumes canvas-editing input (mouse clicks + transform/edit
hotkeys) **only when the pointer is over a 3D viewport**, so the user
can't select or edit objects out from under the agent — but it passes
camera navigation (orbit / pan / zoom, including Mac trackpad
gestures) and leaves every other editor (chat, moodboard, sidebars,
properties) fully interactive.

The Zen Moodboard drawer overlaps the viewport WINDOW rectangle. Its
painted canvas, resize edge and grip must pass through before checking that rectangle;
native hit testing keeps this aligned with the slide, resize and UI scale.
The drawer's transparent remainder remains locked viewport space.

Notification toasts draw INSIDE the viewport but are conceptually a
layer above it, so a left-press landing on a toast control is passed
through too — otherwise no toast could be dismissed or actioned for the
whole duration of an agent turn (window modal handlers run before the
region's toast UI handler, so this modal is the only place that can
yield).

The viewport's top header (the Zen scene toolbar) overlaps the WINDOW
rectangle too. It is chrome, not canvas: an event Blender would route to
one of its controls passes through (native ``Area.mixar_header_contains``,
the event system's own overlap query), so render, shading, playback and
export stay usable and the halo frames the canvas below it. Empty toolbar
space between controls falls through to the canvas in Blender, so it stays
locked here.

The Parallel Agents panel (the worker cards docked bottom-left of the
viewport, VIEW_3D EXECUTE region) is another such layer: its cards exist
almost only WHILE the agent is running, and its eye / dismiss / chevron
controls sit inside the WINDOW region's rect. A left-press over that region
is handed to the panel's own click operator (``view3d.agent_panel_click``,
the C++ hit-test) from here; a press the panel does not claim stays
consumed, so an empty part of the card band never falls through to
viewport selection mid-turn.

Started programmatically by the bootstrap tick when the agent enters
BUSY / MODIFYING; self-stops via a short timer when the agent leaves
those states (so the first post-completion click isn't eaten).
