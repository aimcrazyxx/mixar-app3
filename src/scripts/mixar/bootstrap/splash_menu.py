Splash Menu Replacement

Replaces the native WM_MT_splash menu with a custom version that:
- Hides the Recent Files section
- Shows Donate to Blender and Support links in its place

Also exposes `is_splash_visible()` so other modules (notably the
agent bubble auto-show) can react to splash dismissal regardless of
HOW the user dismissed it (workspace-switching mode pickers, the
File-New entries, or simply clicking outside the popup). The
detection works by timestamping each draw() call: while the splash
popup is on screen Blender re-runs draw() once per frame; once
dismissed, draws stop entirely and the timestamp goes stale.

# Updated on every WM_MT_splash.draw() call. We treat the splash as

# draws stop firing and this stamp goes stale.

# Kept just above is_splash_visible()'s staleness window so onboarding
# starts promptly after dismissal (was 20s, which delayed onboarding ~10s+

      normal visibility heuristic once startup grace has passed.
